Welcome to my daily machine-learning coding projects repository! In this repository, I document my journey as a beginner in machine learning, where I work on various small projects to build my skills and knowledge.

## Project Structure
Each day, I work on a new machine-learning project or concept. Below, I've included a list of my daily updates for you.

### [Supervised Learning - Regression](./Supervised%20Learning%20-%20Regression)
You will find my daily projects related to supervised learning regression tasks in this directory. Click the link to explore these projects.

### [Supervised Learning - Classification](./Supervised%20Learning%20-%20Classification)
You will find my daily projects related to supervised learning classification tasks in this directory. Click the link to explore these projects.
