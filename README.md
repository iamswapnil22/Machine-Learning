# Daily Machine Learning Coding Projects
Welcome to my daily machine-learning coding projects repository! In this repository, I document my journey as a beginner in machine learning, where I work on various small projects to build my skills and knowledge.

## Project Structure
Each day, I work on a new machine-learning project or concept. Below, I've included a list of my daily updates for you.
