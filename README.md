# Daily Machine Learning Coding Projects
Welcome to my daily machine learning coding projects repository! In this repository, I document my journey as a beginner in machine learning, where I work on a variety of small projects to build my skills and knowledge.

## Project Structure
Each day, I work on a new machine learning project or concept. Below, you can find a list of my daily updates.
