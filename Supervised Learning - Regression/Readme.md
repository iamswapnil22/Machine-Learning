# Regression Models Repository


Welcome to the Regression Models Repository! This repository contains various regression models for solving different types of regression problems. Whether you're working with linear regression, polynomial regression, or any other regression task, you'll find a variety of models and code examples to explore.

## Models

Here's a list of some of the regression models included in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Description:** Linear Regression is a fundamental regression algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

2. **Polynomial Regression**
   - **Description:** Polynomial Regression extends linear regression by modeling the relationship as an nth-degree polynomial, which can capture more complex patterns in data.

3. **Ridge Regression**
   - **Description:** Ridge Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that adds L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity.

4. **Lasso Regression**
   - **Description:** Lasso Regression is another regularized linear regression technique that adds L1 regularization, often used for feature selection and sparsity.

5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
   - **Description:** SVR is an extension of support vector machines for regression tasks, which finds a hyperplane that best fits the data within a margin of tolerance.

6. **Decision Tree Regression**
   - **Description:** Decision Tree Regression uses decision tree models to predict continuous values by splitting data into subsets based on features.
