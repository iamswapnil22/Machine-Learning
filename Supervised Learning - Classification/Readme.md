# Classification Models Repository

Welcome to the Classification Models Repository! This repository contains various classification models for solving different types of classification problems. 
Whether you're working with image classification, text classification, or any other classification task, you'll find a variety of models and code examples to 
explore.
This Folder Contains all Codes for each classification model that I built.


## Models

Here's a list of some of the classification models included in this repository:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Description: Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective linear classification algorithm widely used for binary and multiclass classification tasks.

2. **Random Forest**
   - Description: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and handle complex datasets.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Description: SVM is a powerful algorithm for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes.

4. **Naive Bayes**
   - Description: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, commonly used for text classification tasks like spam detection.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Description: KNN is a simple and effective instance-based classification algorithm that assigns labels based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.

6. **Decision Tree**
   - Description: Decision Trees are hierarchical models that make decisions by recursively splitting data into subsets based on features.
